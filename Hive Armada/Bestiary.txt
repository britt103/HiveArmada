        "Ah, The Armada. The pests of the void.  Hiding away in their strange iridium hives, ravaging any planets they deem inferior to their own, artificial worlds. Only those they wish to recruit are spared. An army of empty shells controlled from afar. I wonder if there are human faces behind their eyesï¿½ ",

        "Quick and small, built to confuse. A lovely test of a pilot's aim and tracking skills.",
