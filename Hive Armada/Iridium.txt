        "The Starchaser�s L45A-O rail gun makes use of electromagnetic accelerators to eject plasmoids with pinpoint accuracy. The speed at which the projectile travels is so quick that the payload resembles a star shooting across space, which is why some officers have affectionately nicknamed the weapon the �North Star.� Like said astronomical objects, the rail gun generates enough kinetic and thermal energy to make any unfortunate vessel on the receiving end to feel like a star just crashed into them. The Omega variant attached to the Starchaser is a self-sufficient prototype integrated directly into the ship core, meaning operators need not worry about the weapon breaking down on them so long as the core is functioning.\n+Consistent accuracy and firerate\n-Average DPS",
        "The XM29F Vulcan chaingun was designed to deliver high-velocity carnage through its six-barrel rotary motor. Chewing through lead at a firerate of 2500 RPM, corpsmen jokingly refer to anybody caught in the crosshairs of the armament as scraps for the attack dogs. The Starchaser has been outfitted with a variant that uses armor-piercing HEAT rounds, causing eviscerating damage to hostile armada drones. While an effective piece of equipment, operators should exercise expedience with the weapon, as overuse of the Vulcan over a short period of time will cause internal system overheat, shorting the weapon for a period of time.\n+High accuracy and DPS\n-Overheats after overuse",
        "The APEX Ballistic System launches a multitude of target-seeking rockets towards an opponent�s untimely demise. APEX was modeled after early rocket pods used in ground warfare by drone and mech units, but after the rising use of combat vessels in space, specialists began research on adapting rocket-pod technology to work in low pressure vacuums like outer space. APEX was born shortly after, a missile system with built-in astro-inertial guidance. Operators have found the serpentine maneuver of the RF-98 rockets akin to �unleashing a Leviathan on your enemy,� and rightfully so. In the hands of an experienced and calculated operator, APEX can send a target down with deft execution.\n+Burst potential\n-Short cooldown between shots; precise aim required",
