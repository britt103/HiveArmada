        "The L45A-O rail gun, powered by electromagnetic accelerators, ejects burning plasmoids with pinpoint accuracy. This weapon was chosen as a standard for all Starchaser ships due to its distinct blue color, akin to a shooting star.",
        "The XM29F Vulcan chaingun delivers high-velocity carnage through 6 steel barrels. Despite its power, the Vulcan is prone to overheating with prolonged use.",
        "Developed by the Aurora-Perseus Exchange, the APEX Ballistics System fires a powerful burst of heat-seeking rockets. The system was modeled after early rocket pods used in low-atmosphere dogfights.",
        "Project Haeitlik spawned an experimental electromagnetic plasma launcher. An unorthodox choice, but highly effective against all manner of malicious beings. Operator be warned - The weapon's natural power supply must recharge after each use, requiring more precise shot timing."
