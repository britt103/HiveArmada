        "The Starchaser's L45A-O rail gun makes use of electromagnetic accelerators to eject plasmoids with pinpoint accuracy. The speed at which the projectile travels is so quick that the payload resembles a star shooting across space.",
        "The XM29F Vulcan chaingun was designed to deliver high-velocity carnage through its six-barrel rotary motor. While an effective piece of equipment, operators should exercise expedience with the weapon, as overuse of the Vulcan over a short period of time will cause temporary internal system overheating.",
        "The APEX Ballistic System launches a multitude of target-seeking rockets towards an opponent. The system was modeled after early rocket pods used in ground warfare by drone and mech units, but was later adapted to work in low pressure vacuums like outer space.",
        "Project Haietlik is an experimental directed-energy launcher firing hails of immense plasmatic projectiles. While an unorthodox choice, Haietlik has proven an effective armament against Hive drones. The tesla coil however must be recharged in between usage, making Haietlik a more effective weapon in the hands of a tactical operator."
